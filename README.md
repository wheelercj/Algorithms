# Algorithms

Examples of common algorithms and data structures implemented and tested in C++ (and some in Java).

Requires C++17 or newer. In Visual Studio, you can choose the version of C++ with project > Properties > C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard.

## sorting algorithms

* bubble sort
* selection sort
* insertion sort
* shell sort
* quicksort
* merge sort
* heap sort

## searching algorithms

* linear search
* binary search

## data structures

* linked lists
* coming soon: trees
* coming soon: graphs
